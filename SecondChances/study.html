      The actual civics test is NOT a multiple choice test. During the naturalization interview,
      a USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 questions from the list of 100 questions in English.
      You must answer correctly 6 of the 10 questions to pass the civics test.
      If you go to this website, it will give you a free citizenship practice test.
      Here is an image of what to expect from the practice test.
